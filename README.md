# Emaily customer survey app
Emaily is a fullstack web app that enables companies to get customer feedback via email surveys.  Emaily's implementation employs the 'MERN' tech stack which comprises MongoDB, Express Server, React JS (client), Node JS.  In addition, the app integrates with 3rd party services including Google's OAuth API for authentication functionality, Stripe's payments API for basic payments functionality and Twilio's Send Grid email API for actual sending of email survey campaigns.

The Emaily app is the primary project for Stephen Grider's Udemy course, [Node with React: Fullstack Web Development](https://www.udemy.com/course/node-with-react-fullstack-web-development/).  The project provides hands on practice with core MERN stack concepts and technologies including the following:

- Server Side Architecture with Express and Node
- Implementing Google OAuth authentication
- Implementing MongoDB
- Mastering deployment techniques for prod and dev environments
- Handling Payments with Stripe API
- Creating and Sending emails from a backend server
- Handling Webhook Data
- Developing a client side front end using React, React Router, Redux and Redux-Form
