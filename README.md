# Emaily customer survey app
Emaily is a fullstack web app that enables companies to get customer feedback via email surveys.  I employ the 'MERN' tech stack for my implementation which comprises MongoDB, Express Server, React JS (client), Node JS.  In addition, this app integrates with Google's OAuth API for authentication functionality, Stripe's payments API for basic payments functionality and Twilio's Send Grid email API for actual sending of email survey campaigns.

The Emaily web app is publicly hosted [here](https://calm-fjord-85714.herokuapp.com/).
